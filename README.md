# Snacklab Components

A set of Polymer elements, based on the Google Codelabs platform.

## Dev setup

CD to the root of the project and `bower install` to get all dependencies. 

To run the project locally, you need polyserve: 
[polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve):
`npm install -g polyserve`.

Fire up the server with `polyserve` command and point your browser to:

    http://localhost:8080

Or to where the terminal guides you.

## Development

You will be working in the `steps` folder. Add elements to your snacklab by creating pages in this folder, named appropriatly. Add those pages as well to `snacklab-elements.html` to be imported.
