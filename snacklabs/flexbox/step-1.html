    <p>The introduction of Flexbox to create layouts in NativeScript has opened a whole new world of layouting to developers. 
    Yes, ‘layouting’ is a word, as in ‘Are you going to do any fun layouting this weekend’? 
    Actually, there are two main types of layouting in NativeScript - using the Layouts modules like StackLayout and GridLayout, 
    and Flexbox layouts. You can use either type of layout for your app; 
    those who are a bit familiar with Flexbox on the web might be happy to use Flexbox in their native app.</p>

    <p>What’s the deal with Flexbox, anyway? It’s a well-established way of building up a user interface, especially on the web. 
      The classic example of developing user interfaces with Flexbox is in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">css-tricks</a>; for visual learners (like me), 
      take a look at <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-animated-guide-to-flexbox-d280cf6afc35">this excellent article</a> using animated gifs to explain Flexbox. For a good introduction on using Flexbox with NativeScript, 
      check out <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/blog/a-quick-introduction-to-flexbox-in-nativescript">TJ VanToll’s article on the NativeScript blog</a>. 
      TJ also points us to a really cool learning resource: <a href="http://www.flexboxfroggy.com">flexboxfroggy.com</a>, 
      where you use Flexbox to arrange a frog and a lilypad in a pond.</p>

    <p>The real test of a layouting system, however, occurs when you need to get a real-world layout built, pronto. How about Twitter, for example?</p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>Cloning a well-known UI is a great way to create a proof of concept, so let’s give it a try! 
      Recently it struck me that what the world needs is a Twitter client for cats.

    <p>
      <img src="images/1.png" style="max-width: 500px">
    </p>

    <p>So let's create our own social media for cats, Yowwlr! 
      The project has basic authentication using Firebase, and allows a cat to send yowls (not tweets!). 
      This is a looping layout that is basically a scrolling list of interactions. 
      The layout has a basic shape on mobile: each interaction is comprised of two columns with an image in the first column and three rows stacked in the second column.</p>

    <p>So let's get started!</p>
