    <p>For this app, we are going to store our data, comprised of 'Yowls' (like Tweets, but for cats...), in Firebase. 
      Let's integrate the Firebase plugin from within Sidekick.</p>

    <p>Navigate to the app's 'General' page in Sidekick and select 'Plugins' on the side. A panel appears with a list of the plugins
      that are already installed, as seen in your app's outer package.json file. Navigate to the 'Available' plugins tab and search for 'Firebase'. 
      Select 'nativescript-plugin-firebase', which is the best Firebase plugin available. Click the gear icon and then 'install'. This will add the plugin to your
      package.json file and it will appear in the 'installed' panel in Sidekick.
    </p>
