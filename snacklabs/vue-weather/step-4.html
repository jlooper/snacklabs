    <p>Now we have a shell for our app's data and we need to start populating it. 
        Let's integrate the geolocation plugin and get our device's latitude and longitude.
        You are probably working on a simulator, so if you want, set your simulator's location to a custom
        area. On iOS, go to Debug > Location > Custom Location and enter a value.
    </p>

    <p>On Android, there is an extended control 
            menu that allows you to change the device's location.</p>

    <p>Now that you have set your simulators to listen for location data, 
        we need to install a plugin to get the app's geolocation.</p>

    <aside class="warning">
        <p>Make sure that you use the 3.0.1 version of the Geolocation plugin
            by opening the outer package.json file and changing the plugin version:
            <pre>
                "nativescript-geolocation": "^3.0.1",
            </pre>
        </p>
    </aside>
    <p>Next, add the following lines to the top of the app.js file under the declaration of the Vue constant:</p>

    <pre>
        const Geolocation = require("nativescript-geolocation");
        const Accuracy = require("ui/enums");        
    </pre>

    <aside class="special">
            <p>
              For iOS, you will also need to add a key to your Info.plist which is kept in App_Resources/iOS.
              Add the following to this file, right before the closing </dict> tag:
              <pre>
                    &#x3C;key&#x3E;NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription&#x3C;/key&#x3E;
                    &#x3C;string&#x3E;Let me get your weather while the app is open!&#x3C;/string&#x3E;
                &#x3C;key&#x3E;NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription&#x3C;/key&#x3E;
                    &#x3C;string&#x3E;Let me always ping for the weather, ok?&#x3C;/string&#x3E;&#x9;
            
              </pre>
              This key will allow a popup to show, asking for permission to check location, which is mandatory on iOS.
            </p>
          </aside>

    <p>These two constants will be used to store our location preferences. Next, get the app to test for geolocation when it starts. 
        Populate the getMyWeather() method with the following:</p>

    <pre>
            Geolocation.enableLocationRequest();
            Geolocation.getCurrentLocation({ desiredAccuracy: Accuracy.high, updateDistance: 0.1, timeout: 20000 })
            .then(loc => {
                if (loc) {
                    this.getMyCity(loc.latitude,loc.longitude) 
                    //http call                                 
                }
            }, function(e) {
                console.log("Error: " + e.message);
            });
    </pre>
    
    <p>Next, we can get the city based on the latitude and longitude passed back from the Geolocation routine. 
        At the top of the file, add one more const:</p>
    <pre>const http = require("http");</pre>
    <p>Then use an open API to get the location name, based on the latitude and longitude, by completing the getMyCity() method:</p>

    <pre>
            console.log(lat,long)
            http.request({
                url: "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?format=json&lat="+lat+"&lon="+long+"&zoom=18&addressdetails=1",
                method: "GET"
            }).then(response => {
                var obj = response.content.toJSON()
                console.log(obj.address.city) 
                this.city = obj.address.city      
            })
    </pre>

    <p>In your terminal, you should be able to see the name of the city being returned by this API call as well as your simulator's preset latitude and longitude.</p>
