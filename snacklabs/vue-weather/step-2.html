    <p>In this Snacklab, to create our NativeScript app, we are going to build using the NativeScript CLI. 
      Get started by installing the NativeScript CLI by following <a href="https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup">this installation guide</a>. 
      Once everything is installed as per those instructions, scaffold your app by navigating to a folder on your computer where you want your codebase to reside, 
      and type 'tns create clean-weather --template nativescript-vue-template'. 
      This command will create a template-based app using the Vue plugin. For more information, see <a href="http://www.nativescript-vue.org">the NativeScript-Vue docs</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Navigate to the folder where you created your app and open the project in your favorite IDE. We like Visual Studio Code, but any IDE is fine.
    You can view your app in an emulator by typing 'tns run ios' or 'tns run android'. Out of the box you'll see a whimsical NativeScript app powered by Vue!</p>

    <p>Take a look at the various views available in this sample app. Swap out the initial view by 
      opening the inner 'package.json' file and changing the "main" key: 
      changing "main": "app" to "main": "app-with-list-view" changes the initial 
      view to a reddit-powered list. Play around a little and explore by switching the initial file.
    </p>

            Why not TypeScript? At the moment, the NativeScript-Vue's integration is purely JavaScript based. Watch this space for upcoming tutorials using TypeScript, coming soon!            
          </p>

    <p>Congratulations, you have a new NativeScript-Vue app ready to work on! 
      By running your app using the NativeScript CLI, the app should refresh using LiveSync each time you make code changes
      since you are running it using 'tns run'. Now, with your emulation environment set up, you're ready to start development.</p>

          Note, there several different ways to manage your Vue 
          workflow with NativeScript. One is the way we'll do it 
          here, with one file containing our app's logic. 
          A second way is using multiple .vue files and either 
          Webpack or Rollup. You can take a look at the various 
          methods <a href="http://nativescript-vue.org/#/templates">here</a>. 
          We'll discuss using those latter 
          workflows in future Snacklabs.
