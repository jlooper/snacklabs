    <p>As we did in the first Snacklab, to create our NativeScript app, we are going to leverage Sidekick, a tool that helps you quickly get up and running to
      build mobile apps. Get started by downloading Sidekick and completing all the installation steps listed <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-sidekick">here</a>.
      Once everything is installed, scaffold your app by choosing the new 'Vue' template. 
    </p>

    <p>Open Sidekick and click the blue 'Create' button. You are prompted to create a new app. Name your new app CleanWeather and
      select 'NativeScript + JavaScript' and ensure that the 'Blank' template is selected, then wait for your app to be scaffolded.</p>

      <aside class="special">
        <p>
          While we're using Sidekick to scaffold a plain JavaScript app, you can also play with a Vue integration using the experimental Vue template in the <a href="http://play.nativescript.org">NativeScript Playground</a>.

    <p>What just happened? To see your app in a local emulator, make sure that an emulator is open, and then select <b>Run > Run on Device</b>.
      The emulator that you have open will be listed in the following screen so select it and then select 'Local Build' and
      'Run on Device'.</p>

            Why not TypeScript? At the moment, the NativeScript-Vue's

    <p>If all went well, you should see the app on the local emulator.</p>

    <p>Congratulations, you have a new NativeScript app ready to work on! Now, let's make your workflow even easier. Go back to your app's 'General' screen and select 'Livesync' at the top. With
      your emulator still open, toggle the switch for livesync to 'on' for 
      the emulator you are currently using. Now, when you make changes in your code, you will be able to see the emulator refresh automatically without having to rerun it manually.</p>

    <p>Now, with your emulation environment set up, you're ready to start development. Open the codebase that you scaffolded earlier in your favorite editor - we recommend Visual Studio Code.</p>

          Note, there several different ways to manage your Vue 
          workflow with NativeScript. One is the way we'll do it 
          here, with one file containing our app's logic. 
          A second way is using multiple .vue files and either 
          Webpack or Rollup. You can take a look at the various 
          methods <a href="http://nativescript-vue.org/#/templates">here</a>. 
          We'll discuss using those latter 
          workflows in future Snacklabs.
